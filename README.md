## Features

- Fetches official F1 2025 schedule via [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repo

cd f1-google-calendar-updater
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up Google Calendar API

- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Create a project and enable the **Google Calendar API**
